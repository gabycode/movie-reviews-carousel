                <img src="./images/hiro bh6.jfif" alt="big hero 6, hiro and baymax">
                <h2>Big Hero 6</h2>
                <p class="release-year">2015</p>
                <p class="desc">Even though Hiro and Tadashi don't get the happily ever, this is still a story about the
                    power of brotherly love, encouragement, and support.
                    Baymax is the movie's most unique character, the perfect companion to young Hiro's jaded sense of
                    doom about a world in which someone you love can be gone in a flash.</p>

                <img src="./images/merida brave.jfif" alt="big hero 6 movie poster">
                <h2>Brave</h2>
                <p class="release-year">2012</p>
                <p class="desc">This is a great-looking movie, much enlivened by the inspiration of giving Merida three
                    small brothers, little redheaded
                    triplets. The Scottish Highlands are thrillingly painted in astonishing detail, and some action
                    shows Merida's archery
                    more than equal in assorted emergencies.</p>

                <img src="./images/judy and nick.png" alt="big hero 6 movie poster">
                <h2>Zootopia</h2>
                <p class="release-year">2016</p>
                <p class="desc">Zootopia is constantly asking its characters to look past species stereotypes, and not
                    use species-ist language or
                    repeat hurtful assumptions. Only a bunny can call another bunny 'cute,' Hops warns a colleague. It's
                    filled with moments
                    that are about overcoming or enduring discrimination.</p>

            <!-- Movie Item 4 -->
            <div class="carousel-item">
                <img src="./images/Inside-Out-preview.jpg" alt="big hero 6 movie poster">
                <h2>Inside Out</h2>
                <p class="release-year">2015</p>
                <p class="desc">The script seems as if it's favoring Joy's interpretation of things, and what the other
                    emotions ought to "do" for Riley. But soon we realize that
                    Sadness has just as much of value to contribute, that Anger, Fear and Disgust are useful as well,
                    and that none of them
                    should be prized to the exclusion of the rest. </p>
